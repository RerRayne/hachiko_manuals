# Hachiko Manuals
Manuals for DXG-1 servers Hachiko 1, 2 in Skoltech.

## How get access
1. You have to be a Ph.D student or an employee at Skoltech.
2. Ask your supervisor/manager for access.
3. Redirect to @rerayne a granted permission she'll make you an account.
4. E-mail helpdesk@skoltech.ru and request Skoltech VPN and usage instructions. 
5. Read very thorough this manual before you start.
6. In any urgent or uncertan situation contact [Emergency contacts](#Emergency_contacts) ASAP.

## Main rules
 1. DXG-1 uses nvidia-docker. That's why, please read a starting manual about this system. <add link>
 2. Always use  nvidia-docker instead just docker if you want to use GPUs
 3. Don't keep a lot of docker images running. Running container takes a lot of HDD.
 4. Each user creates docker for their needs. Docker's name **HAS TO** contain user's surname. Failure to satisfy this rule could result a termination of the container
 5. Don't hold resources that you don't need right now. If you work in iPython notebook release all cards you hold through kernel termination. A looped process could be terminated without saving the sate and data
 6. Limit your resources using special keys when you start your docker container. <add link>
 7. When you're starting your docker you can mount any local directory by adding ```-v <local_dir>:<docker_dir>``` to the starting command
 8. NEVER attach the root directory to your docker. It could result a total crash of the system. Just never do it. If you want to delete any folder but can't just contact [Emergency contacts](#Emergency_contacts)
 9. All datasets have to be stored in a corresponding RAID directory: ```/raid/data/datasets```. <add nstruction how to mount>
 10. Save as little data in your home directory as you can. The rest of has to be stored in ```/raid/data/%username%``` directory. <add nstruction how to mount>
 11. It's good idea to get familiar with tmux or screen apps for remote sessions.
 12. To check amount of available GPUs and CPUs use ```watch nvidia-smi``` and ```htop``` correspondingly.
 13. To map identically ports from your docker to its host you can add --net="host" to starting command. For example:
 ```bash
     nvidia-docker run --name tensor_compression -it -v /home/lmarkeeva/workspace/nntc:/workspace/nntc -v /raid:/workspace/raid --net="host" tc:1.0.1 --net="host"
 ```
